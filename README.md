KillWEBP intercepts WebP image requests and automatically converts them to PNG format before they're displayed in your browser. This happens in real-time with minimal performance impact. The extension maintains a counter of all conversions and estimates space saved through the conversion process.

## Performance Impact

KillWEBP is designed to be lightweight and efficient. The extension runs in the background with minimal CPU and memory usage. Conversion happens almost instantly for most images.

## Privacy

KillWEBP operates entirely within your browser. No data is sent to external servers, and no browsing history is collected. The extension only accesses image data when a WebP image is detected.
