**Abandon WebP. Long live PNG!**

## Overview

I hate Webp, If you are a webp hater then welcome to the club!

## Why?

Yes Google created WebP image format so that website with images embedded in it will load faster, but me as a user who frequently download images from various websites, it is a pain in the ass to view webps, sometimes I dont have the application for it, sometimes it opens an image editor instead of Photos app, so i prefer these images to be converted in .PNG (Portable Network Graphic) format or .JPEG (Joint Photographic Expert Group).



## Features

- **Automatic WebP Detection**: Identifies WebP images across all websites
- **High-Quality PNG Conversion**: Converts WebP to PNG with customizable quality settings (70-100%)
- **Reddit WebP Bypass**: Special handling for Reddit's WebP implementation (I tried downloading sexy images of ryuuge kisaki here in reddit, its in autowebp format so yeah its png now suckers)
- **Conversion Statistics**: Tracks how many WebP images you've "killed" and how much space you've saved
- **Customizable Settings**: set your settings
- **Browser Cache Management**: Clean your cache?
- **Notification System**: Optional conversion notifications

## Performance Impact

KillWEBP is designed to be lightweight and efficient. The extension runs in the background with minimal CPU and memory usage. Conversion happens almost instantly for most images.

## Privacy

KillWEBP operates entirely within your browser. No data is sent to external servers, and no browsing history is collected. The extension only accesses image data when a WebP image is detected.
