## Installation

1. Download the extension from [Chrome Web Store](#) or [Firefox Add-ons](#)
2. Click "Add to Chrome" or "Add to Firefox"
3. The extension icon will appear in your browser toolbar
4. Click the icon to access settings and start killing WebP images!

## How It Works

KillWEBP intercepts WebP image requests and automatically converts them to PNG format before they're displayed in your browser. This happens in real-time with minimal performance impact. The extension maintains a counter of all conversions and estimates space saved through the conversion process.

## Settings

- **Enable Extension**: Toggle the extension on/off
- **PNG Quality**: Adjust the quality of PNG conversion (higher quality = larger file size)
- **Show Notifications**: Toggle notifications when WebP images are converted
- **Auto Download**: Automatically download converted images without prompts
- **Reddit WebP Bypass**: Special handling for Reddit's WebP implementation

## Performance Impact

KillWEBP is designed to be lightweight and efficient. The extension runs in the background with minimal CPU and memory usage. Conversion happens almost instantly for most images.

## Privacy

KillWEBP operates entirely within your browser. No data is sent to external servers, and no browsing history is collected. The extension only accesses image data when a WebP image is detected.
